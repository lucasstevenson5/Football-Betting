### 🔄 How It Works

**Frontend:**

4. Updates header to show selected season

**Backend:**
- Updated season detection logic in `nfl_data_service.py`
- Season detection now considers September as start of new season
- All API endpoints use consistent season logic
- Ready to fetch 2025 data when available from NFL API

### 🎨 UI Updates

**Season Selector:**
- Gradient background (purple to blue)
- White text for contrast
- Prominent placement in filter bar
- Min width of 150px for readability

**Season Info Bar:**
- White background with subtle shadow
- Large, bold season title

### 🚀 Usage

**To view different seasons:**
1. Open http://localhost:5173
2. Look for the "Season:" dropdown at the top
3. Select any year (2020-2024)
4. Data automatically refreshes for that season

**Example:**
